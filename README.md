# Wireless Sense Wii
Wireless Sense is a project I'm creating where I try to create a wireless Wii sensor bar to possibly prevent random knocking down or any problems with wires. This repository contains the PCBs and 3D printer files.

## You will need:
### Tools:
- Soldering Iron
  - Solder (things like that)
- 3D Printer (Optional)
### Items:
- 8x IR LED
- 3.7v Lipo
- LiPo Charger
- 100ohm Resistor
- Slide Switch (SPDT)
- Normal LED (any color, optional)
- screws (possibly, no specification yet)

## What to Do
Once it's out, you can follow a video tutorial (coming in about a month)

If you're this early, here are the instructions.

1. Print out a PCB, get your items ready.
2. Once you have the PCB, solder the items on accordingly.
3. If you have a 3D printer, you can continue and print the case.
4. Assemble the case with the board and external charger fitted.
5. Turn the sensor on and turn on your Wii, there should be no other setup neccessary.
